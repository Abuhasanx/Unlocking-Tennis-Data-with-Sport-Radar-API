# Tennis Data with Sport Radar API
I retrieved competition, complex, and competitor data from the SportRadar API and processed it in Python by organizing the data into lists using loops. The data was converted into a DataFrame with pandas and exported to a CSV file. Using XAMPP as the MySQL server, I connected Python to the database and performed analysis through SQL queries. To visualize and interact with the data, I developed a Streamlit application, integrating SQL and pandas to analyze tennis data and present insights through an intuitive interface.
